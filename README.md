# Exercises

I am on a quest to figure out my sweet spot by doing exercises from [Exercises for Programmers](https://pragprog.com/book/bhwb/exercises-for-programmers) in the languages that have piqued my interest the most.

Target languages:

* [Clojure](https://clojure.org/)
* [F#](https://fsharp.org/)
* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)

I am just going to store solutions here without any context or information from the book. I suppose this repo warrants a **SPOILER ALERT**.
